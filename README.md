## Features:
- ***Barbaric*** - This weapon is imbued with the soul of a barbarian, unleashing its might when vulnerable the most.* Does more damage when lower on durability. Incompatible with Mending and Unbreaking for balance. Can be enchanted. It is intended to be used on Golden Axes & Swords - allowing one to use a very-effective and high-damage weapon when in times of need.
